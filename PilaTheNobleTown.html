                  Pila, Laguna is a unique place. It is the only town in the
                  Philippines that is formally recognized as a historical site
                  by both the church and the state. The National Historical
                  Institute declared the town center a National Historical
                  Landmark on 17 May 2000. The Diocese of San Pablo, on the
                  other hand, proclaimed the parish church of San Antonio de
                  Padua de Pila-the first Antonine parish in the Philippines-as
                  the Diocesan Shrine of St. Anthony on 9 July 2002.

                  Even before the Spaniards arrived, Pila (an ancient Tagalog
                  word meaning soft stone) was a religious, cultural and
                  commercial center in the region surrounding the great lake,
                  which came to be known as Laguna de Bay. The oldest written
                  record in the Philippines, a copper plate dating to 900 AD and
                  found in nearby Lumbang, mentions the town and leaders of
                  "Pailah" twice and "Puliran." These possibly refer to Pila and
                  Pulilan, respectively, the latter being the old name of the
                  western portion of the lake near which Pila lies. According to
                  oral traditions, from the center in Pinagbayanan, and later in
                  Pagalangan, the datu (chief) of Pila ruled over one of the
                  biggest territories in the area, which extended as far as
                  Talim Island, Tanay, and other lakeshore towns.

                        The Augustinians were the first missionaries in Pila.
                        When the Franciscans arrived in 1578, they took over the
                        evangelization of the town and built a church of
                        hardwood and bamboo dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua.
                        The mission became a parish on 13 June 1581. And so Pila
                        became the first Antonine parish in the Philippines.

                  The Franciscans established in Pila the second printing press
                  in the Philippines in 1611. The first Spanish-Tagalog
                  dictionary (Vocabulario de Lengua Tagala) was printed in Pila
                  in 1613 by Tomás Pinpin and Domingo Loag. (It was 25 years
                  older than the first book published in the United States in
                  1638). The local pastor, Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura of the
                  Franciscan Order, compiled the dictionary to facilitate the
                  evangelization of the Tagalog region.

                  During their occupation of Pila from 1762 to 1764, the British

                  For almost a quarter of a century (1812-1835), Filipino
                  secular priests served for the first time as the acting
                  pastors of Pila due to a shortage of Franciscan friars. In
                  c1825 they finished constructing the new church, into which
                  they had recycled almost stone by stone the old church in
                  Pagalangan. The Franciscan pastors who succeeded them

                  surround- preserving Don Felizardo de Rivera's imprint impart
                  a distinctive ambience to the town. But the economic boom
                  ended in the thirties when the coconut industry in Laguna
                  collapsed and the Great Depression struck.

                  Just when Pila's economy was beginning to take off again, the
                  Second World War was declared between Japan and the United
                  States, overrunning the Philippines in 1941. Ironically,
                  during this time of war, the rice boom in the town reached its
                  zenith. Pila became the rice granary of Laguna. The Pileños
                  unselfishly shared their bounty with the surrounding towns and
                  as far as Manila and its suburbs, saving them from starvation.

                  Pila was also the guerilla center in the province. It was the
                  first town in Laguna to be liberated by the grateful guerillas
                  in January 1945, completely sparing it from destruction by the
                  clashing Japanese and American forces.
