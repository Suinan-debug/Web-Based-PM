                  Laguna de Bay, especially along its coasts and rivers, was
                  highly accessible to foreign vessels bringing merchants with
                  goods to trade for local products. Movement of goods and
                  people also flowed into the Laguna de Bay area from Manila
                  Bay, linking it with the wider geographical area including
                  Sta. Ana, or Lamayan. Flat, arable land and bountiful protein
                  foods, such as fish and eels, made the Laguna de Bay area a
                  highly attractive place. Chroniclers have long fantasized that
                  kingdoms and chiefdoms flourished here in pre-Hispanic times.
                  Judging from the wealth of ceramics recovered in the area, it
                  can be surmised that the people in this area were quite
                  prosperous.

                  In 1958, Dr. Robert Fox of the Anthropology Division of the
                  National Museum led a team that conducted a controlled
                  archaeological excavation at Calatagan, Batangas. He published
                  his findings the following year, making people in the area
                  suddenly aware that their environs were a rich source of pots
                  and other artifacts highly desired by dealers and collectors.
                  Later day archaeologists jokingly refer to Dr. Fox as the
                  person who trained the first "pothunters." Needing assistance
                  from the local people, he indeed taught workers rudimentary
                  methods of archaeology or "how to dig pots out of the ground."
                  Using their newly acquired skills, these diggers moved to
                  other parts of Batangas, as well as Laguna and Mindoro to dig
                  for pots as a lucrative means of livelihood.

                  In the mid-1960s, news spread like wildfire that celadon had
                  been discovered in Gatid by an enterprising ex-farmer turned
                  dealer. It led to a mad rush of diggings in the neighboring
                  barrios of Pinagbayanan and Duhat followed by Victoria, Bay,
                  Lumbang and Sta. Rosa. Qingbai, early blue and white, celadon,
                  brown-glazed wares, lead-glazed, spotted qingbai and rare
                  underglaze red wares were found. Those were the days of the
                  great Laguna pot rush. Small stores and roadside stalls of
                  antique pottery for sale could be found on both sides of the
                  highway leading from Pila to Sta. Cruz.

                  Standard Philippines together with Mr. and Mrs. Manuel
                  Elizalde decided to provide funds for an archaeological
                  project focused on the Laguna de Bay area. The project was led
                  by Ms. Julita G. Fernandez and Ms. Amelia O. Rogel, graduate
                  students in anthropology at the University of the Philippines,

                  Ten archaeological excavations were conducted from May to
                  October 1967, first in Balibago at Talim Island, Rizal, and
                  then in Pinagbayanan and Bagong Pook, Pila and Lumban, Laguna.
                  One hundred fifty-three graves dating from the 12th to the
                  15th centuries were exposed at three of the four sites. Trade
                  pottery was used to date the sites and provide a time range
                  for the occupation of the area.

                  conducted systematic excavations in Sta. Ana. They uncovered
                  hundreds of graves and carefully recorded their finds. In
                  September 1967, together with researchers from the University
                  of San Carlos (USC), they embarked on another project, this
                  time in Pila's barrio of Pinagbayanan. Archaeologist Rosa C.

                  The discovery of many water droppers led Dr. Tenazas to
                  hypothesize that there might have been a Chinese settlement in
                  the area that practiced calligraphy. Ceramic historians later
                  contended that the presence of such artifacts does not mean
                  that these objects were used in recipient countries, such as
                  the Philippines, for the same purposes for which they were
                  manufactured in China. Current thinking is that wares exported
                  by the Chinese to the countries of the Nanhai (South Seas)
                  were a surplus from the domestic market. In China, these were
                  minyao (people's wares). However, the same kilns produced
                  wares such as the balimbing and kendi to fill specific orders

                  In Pinagbayanan, a remolding of ordinary pottery net sinkers

                  Cremation burials at the Pinagbayanan sites were either
                  directly in a pit (12 burials) or in a container or vessel (38
                  burials). The vessels ranged from a small brown, four-eared
                  jar to large brown stoneware jars, which accounted for about
                  two thirds of the 38 burials. In one instance, the burial was

                    primary burial to allow the body to decompose, the bones were
                    collected and burned in some form of ritual before a second
                    burial. Dr. Tenazas reported that secondary burials have a

                  The practice of burning exhumed bones is a ritual of

              The huge volume of ceramics found in the Laguna de Bay area as well as in Calatagan, Batangas and Puerto Galera and other sites in Mindoro indicate that traders brought these materials into the area. Although the Chinese had become heavily involved in the trade in the 12th and 13th centuries, no other evidence exists to suggest they settled in the places where they traded, except perhaps to wait for the monsoon to pass. From the ceramics, however, it may be surmised that prosperous settlements not necessarily Chinese flourished in the region.

            In his astute 13th century document, Zhao Rugua has provided us with clear descriptions of the exchange of goods and social interaction that occurred between Chinese traders and the early inhabitants of Ma-i and the other islands belonging to it. According to Zhao Rugua, the Chinese bartered their "porcelain trade wares, trade metals, tripod vessels, black lead, variegated glass beads, iron needles, etc."... for the indigenous products of "cotton, yellow wax, pearls, tortoiseshells, medicinal betel nuts, and Yuta cloth."

          Elements of a Hindu or Hindu-Buddhistic culture-as described by Zhao Rugua in the Zhufanshi, and as have surfaced in evidences of cremation at Pinagbayanan, phallic symbols and place names provide an intriguing glimpse of Hindu, Buddhist and Chinese influences.

        More recent research has not provided many additional clues. Hard evidence of any Indian or Chinese settlement in the Philippines prior to the 16th century does not exist. Prehistorians and archaeologists believe that the earliest voyagers plying the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean were Southeast Asians, who were influenced by the places they visited.

      With the limited archaeology that has been done in Pila and its environs, much has been brought to light about previously little-known facets of human behavior in the historically and archaeologically rich Laguna de Bay area.
